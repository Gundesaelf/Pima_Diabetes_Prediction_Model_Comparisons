# Diabetes Prediction Project

## Overview  
Predicting diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (Kaggle). The focus is on data cleaning, feature engineering, and comparing three ML models to build a simple, interpretable prediction tool.

## Tools & Libraries  
- Python (VS Code)  
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, colorama  

## Data Preprocessing  
- Replace zero-values in key columns with NaN  
- Impute missing values using column means  
- Feature selection (drop Age to test impact)  
- Train-test split (50/50, random_state=43)

## Models Tested  
- Gaussian Naive Bayes  
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
Each model was tested in baseline form and with class weighting to handle imbalanced data.

## Evaluation Metrics  
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1 Score  

A detailed classification report and visualizations are available in the report.
